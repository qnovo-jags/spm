# Single Particle Model with Electrolyte Effects (SPMe) in MATLAB/Simulink

This repository provides the Simulink/MATLAB framework to run the Single Particle Model with the Electrolyte effects (aka - SPMe). SPMe are the physics based models to simulate a lithium-ion battery.

## Prerequisites 

You need to have the following:

1. **Git**
   - Installed and configured on your machine.

2. **SSH Connection**
   - An established SSH connection with the company's GitHub.

3. **Repository Access**
   - None at the moment
     
4. **MATLAB and Simulink**
   - Installed and properly configured.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and execute the SPMe:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

2. **Run the code**
   
   1. You would need to run the project file - 'Single_particle_model.prj' before running anything in the repo.
   2. Verify the setup process by running one of the scripts under the `run` directory.
